ToDo App

Introduction:

The ToDo App is a simple application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to create and manage tasks in a graphical user interface (GUI). The app provides features such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, and displaying tasks in a treeview format.

Key Concepts

Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating GUI applications. It provides a set of tools and widgets for building graphical interfaces. SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that is widely used for small-scale applications. It allows the ToDo App to store and retrieve task data. Treeview: The Treeview widget in Tkinter is used to display hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. In the ToDo App, the Treeview is used to show the list of tasks. Code Structure The code for the ToDo App is structured as follows:

Importing the necessary modules: The code begins by importing the required modules, including Tkinter, SQLite, and messagebox. Defining the ToDoWindow class: The ToDoWindow class is a subclass of the Tk class from Tkinter. It represents the main window of the app. Initializing the app: The init method of the ToDoWindow class is called when an instance of the class is created. It sets up the window title, size, and styles, and creates the header and content sections of the app. Configuring styles: The configure_styles method is used to define the styles for various elements in the app, such as labels, buttons, and the treeview. Creating the header: The create_header method creates the header section of the app, which displays the title. Creating the content: The create_content method creates the content section of the app, which includes an entry field for adding new tasks, a button for adding tasks, a treeview for displaying tasks, and a button for deleting tasks. Filling the tasks treeview: The fill_tasks_treeview method retrieves the tasks from the database and populates the treeview with the task data. Handling button clicks: The add_button_click and delete_button_click methods are called when the corresponding buttons are clicked. They perform the necessary actions, such as adding or deleting tasks. Handling treeview row selection: The tasks_treeview_row_selection method is called when a row in the treeview is selected. It sets a flag to indicate that a task is selected and stores the selected task data. Running the app: The last few lines of code create an instance of the ToDoWindow class and start the main event loop.
